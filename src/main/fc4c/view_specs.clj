;; You might ask: why copy specs over from a different namespace? It’s because
;; when the views are parsed from YAML files and we end up with non-namespaced
;; keyword keys, and we then post-process them to qualify them with namespaces,
;; it’s impractical to qualify them with _different_ namespaces, so we’re going
;; to qualify them all with _the same_ namespace. Thus, that namespace needs to
;; include definitions for -all- the keys that appear in the YAML files.
