# 2. The Textual Notation « The FC4 Methodology

We have a few key requirements for our textual notation:

| We need…                                             | so that…                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| the _source_ of our diagrams to be textual in nature | we can use Git and GitHub to usefully track the revision history of the diagrams and to conduct effective peer reviews of changes. |
| the source of our diagrams to be _structured data_   | the information of a diagram can be machine-readable and machine-writeable — i.e. so that software tooling can consume and/or generate the information. |
| the source to be human readable and writeable        | people can efficiently and effectively author and review the source of the diagrams. |

For now we are using a [YAML](http://yaml.org) format that meets these requirements. It comes from,
and is supported by, [Structurizr Express](https://structurizr.com/help/express), a tool described
in [The Toolset](toolset.md).

The format supports describing:

* The type of the diagram
* The scope (subject) of the diagram
* The elements (vertices) that appear on the diagram
* The relationships (edges) that connect the elements
* Custom styles

Each diagram is manifested as a single YAML file using this format.

You can find a detailed description of the format in [the Structurizr Express help](https://structurizr.com/help/express).

We don’t currently have a specification for this format, but if we continue using it much longer we’ll create one.

## Considering the Possible Separation of Content and Presentation

The format we’re currently using is not limited to the semantic definitions of our elements and their relationships; it also requires that the position of each element be specified, and supports limited styling directives.

One idea comes up frequently when technical folks see this: maybe we should keep semantic information (content) separate from presentation information (positions and styles) — e.g. maybe in two separate files, rather than in a single file.

We have decided not to pursue such an approach *for now*, because:

1. It’d be more complicated.
2. The whole point of this approach is to produce diagrams, which are _visual_ artifacts.
   1. We are producing these visual artifacts because they can be an extremely efficient and effective way for people to learn a large amount of high-quality information about systems.
   2. The degree to which these learning experiences are successful — efficient and effective — is highly dependent on the expressiveness of the visual elements. In other words, the layout and the other visual aspects of a diagram are both critical to the value of the diagram.
   3. Therefore, the presentation-related information is integral and crucial to these diagrams, and should not be considered ancillary or secondary.

This is not to rule out the possibility of eventually moving to a different format which might separate the graph information and presentation information that make up a diagram. We’re just not going to do so _right now_.
