# FC4 Framework » Getting Started With an Existing Corpus

Hello!

This guide is for new users who are themselves new to FC4 but would like to
learn how to work on an existing FC4 [corpus](../../concepts.md#corpus). Perhaps
you’ve joined a new team or a new organization; either way, we’re happy to help.

If that’s you, please proceed to [Prep](prep.md).

If you don’t have a pre-existing FC4 corpus that you’d like to work on, you may
be interested in our guide
[Getting Started From Scratch](../getting-started-from-scratch/index.md).
