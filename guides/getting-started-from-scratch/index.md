# FC4 Framework » Getting Started From Scratch

Hello!

This guide is for new users who are completely new to FC4 and will be starting
completely from scratch — meaning, in particular, that you don’t want/need to
work with an existing FC4 [corpus](../../concepts.md#corpus) that may already
exist within your team or organization.

If that’s you, please proceed to [Prep](prep.md).

If your team/org already has an FC4 corpus and you’re looking to learn how to
work on it, we have a guide for you:
[Getting Started With an Existing Corpus](../getting-started-existing-corpus/index.md).
