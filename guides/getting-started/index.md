# FC4 Framework » Getting Started

by [Avi Flax](mailto:avi.flax@fundingcircle.com)

## Welcome!

[FC4](/) is a [_Docs as Code_](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) framework that enables software creators to author, publish, and maintain software architecture diagrams more effectively, efficiently, and collaboratively over time.

For an introduction please see [the home page](/).

## First Time?

Hello!

Before we start creating diagrams, we need to do some prep. And the specific
prep we need to do depends on this:

**Are you starting from scratch with FC4, or do you need to get up and running
with an existing FC4 corpus?**

Please choose your adventure:

* If are starting from scratch, turn to
  [page 1a](prep-starting-from-scratch.md)
* If you need to get up and running with an existing FC4 corpus, turn to
  [page 1b](prep-existing-corpus.md)
