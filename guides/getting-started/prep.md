# FC4 Framework » [Getting Started](index.md) » Part 2: Prep

## First Time?

Before we create a model, a view, some styles, and ultimately some diagrams, we
need to do some prep.

The specific prep we need to do depends on this:

**Are you starting from scratch with FC4, or do you need to get up and running
with an existing FC4 corpus?**

Please choose your adventure:

* If are starting from scratch, turn to
  [page 2a](prep-starting-from-scratch.md)
* If you need to get up and running with an existing FC4 corpus, turn to
  [page 2b](prep-existing-corpus.md)
