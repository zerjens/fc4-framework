# FC4 Framework » Getting Started » Modeling

Now that you’re [prepped](index.md), the next step is to
[model](../../concepts.md#model) the system you wish to diagram.

By “model” all we mean is to document the subject using [the FC4
DSL](../../reference/dsl.md).

## Start fc4-tool

If you haven’t already done so, start [fc4-tool](../../methodology/toolset.md):

```shell
~/dev/docs/fc4 $ fc4 edit
```

<aside>

* The tool will check that its working directory is an FC4
  [corpus](../../concepts.md#corpus) and will warn if it isn’t
* If you haven’t placed the tool’s files in a directory that’s included in your
  shell’s PATH environment variable, then you’ll need to specify the full path
  to the `fc4` executable

</aside>

We suggest opening a second terminal tab/window in which to run file-related
commands.

## Create the File

Create a new file to contain the definition of Spline Reticulator:

```shell
~/dev/docs/fc4 $ touch model/spline-reticulator.yaml
```

Then open that file in your editor of choice, and paste in this YAML:

```yaml
system:
  Spline Reticulator:
    description: Reticulates all the splines without breaking a sweat
```

It may not look like much, but that’s a valid minimal definition of a system in
the FC4 DSL. Now that we’ve defined it, it can be included in
[views](../../concepts.md#view) (which yield diagrams).

Save the file if you haven’t yet, then switch back to the terminal tab in which
fc4-tool is running. You should see output like this:

```
2019-03-04T18:19:20 model/spline-reticulator.yaml » ok
```

This tells us that fc4-tool has noticed the new file and validated its contents.

## Containers

While the above _is_ a valid system definition, it’s not particularly interesting.

A view with that system as its subject would be quite boring.

So let’s add some more information about our system:

```yaml
system:
  Spline Reticulator:
    description: Reticulates all the splines without breaking a sweat
    ### ------ new stuff below this line ------
    containers:
      Flux Capacitor:
        description: Stores up that flux for quick release
      Job Queue:
        description: Gets those jobs done
      Main Brain:
        description: In your business, running your logic
```

### Connections

As you can see, we’ve added three [containers](../../reference/concepts.md#container)
to the definition. A view of this system would now be slightly more interesting.

But there are still no connections defined, so our view would yield a diagram
showing a bunch of floating boxes with no lines connecting them.

Let’s fix that:

```yaml
system:
  Spline Reticulator:
    description: Reticulates all the splines without breaking a sweat
    containers:
      Flux Capacitor:
        description: Stores up that flux for quick release
        ### this property is new:
        uses:
          Job Queue:
            description: Pulls jobs off the queue
      Job Queue:
        description: Gets those jobs done
      Main Brain:
        description: In your business, running your logic
        ### this property is new:
        uses:
          Job Queue:
            description: Puts jobs on the queue
          Flux Capacitor:
            description: Puts flux in, takes flux out
```

Now we’re getting somewhere. We’ve specified that the _Flux Capacitor_ container
uses the _Job Queue_, and the _Main Brain_ container uses both the _Job Queue_
and the _Flux Capacitor_.

## Context

At this point, we’ve covered all the internals of our subject system. So it’s
time to shift our focus to its [context](../../concepts.md#context). That means
specifying the [users](../../concepts.md#user) and systems with which our
subject interacts.

### Users

All systems have users, in the sense that there are always people who derive
value from the features of a system — otherwise, the system would have no reason
to exist. Usually, users interact directly with a system, but sometimes the
interaction is indirect.

So let’s add a user to our model.

Create a new file:

```shell
~/dev/docs/fc4 $ touch model/grace-hopper.md
```

Open it in your editor and paste in these contents:

```yaml
user:
  Grace Hopper:
    description: >
      Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy
      rear admiral. ...she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented
      one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of
      machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of
      COBOL... source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper
    uses:
      Spline Reticulator:
        to: Reticulate those splines
```

There, now our system has a user — and quite a distinguished one at that!

<aside>

* FC4 allows systems and users to be defined in as many, or as few, files as the
  user wishes. A corpus could describing, say one hundred systems and users
  could describe them all in a single file, or in one hundred files, or
  somewhere in between when there’s some logical grouping that’d be meaningful
  and useful for documentarians working on the corpus (e.g. by business domain
  or business unit).
* When defining multiple systems or users in a file, the root key used must be
  in the plural form: `systems` rather than `system` and `users` rather than
  `user`.
* Within this guide we’ll be using a single file for each system and user, just
  for simplicity and convenience. This cardinality is not recommended or
  counter-recommended; it’s used here as an expediency.

</aside>

### Other Systems

There’s one last major aspect of our subject that we should add: connections to
other systems. First, we’ll need to define another system.

<aside>

* While not universal, it’s extremely common for a system to interact with other
  systems
* These other systems might be application-level systems providing APIs or
  similar features to the subject, or they might be lower-level plumbing, such
  as DNS.

</aside>

Create a new file:

```shell
~/dev/docs/fc4 $ touch model/splinecheck-api.md
```

Open it in your editor and paste in these contents:

```yaml
system:
  SplineCheck API:
    description: Web API that checks splines for correctness
    tags:
    - external
    - tech: web
```

This should look familiar. The only thing that’s new is the `tags` property.
This allows you to associate arbitrary metadata with any system, user, and
container. Within FC4, this is used mainly to apply styles. Tags can also be
useful when using custom tools to read the FC4 model for uses outside of the
scope of FC4 itself. (Tags may be simple strings or name/value pairs.)

Now, in your editor, switch back to `spline-reticulator.yaml` and update its
contents to:

```yaml
system:
  Spline Reticulator:
    description: Reticulates all the splines without breaking a sweat
    containers:
      Flux Capacitor:
        description: Stores up that flux for quick release
        uses:
          Job Queue:
            description: Pulls jobs off the queue
      Job Queue:
        description: Gets those jobs done
      Main Brain:
        description: In your business, running your logic
        uses:
          Job Queue:
            description: Puts jobs on the queue
          Flux Capacitor:
            description: Puts flux in, takes flux out
    ### ------ new stuff below this line ------
    uses:
      SplineCheck API:
        to: Check the splines
```

----

That’s it — we now have a valid and nontrivial model of our
[landscape](../../concepts.md#landscape)!
