## Commit the Changes

```shell
~/repos/docs/fc4 $ git add . \
                     && git commit -a -m 'Model + View for Spline Reticulator'
```

## Request Review

A key goal of FC4 is to make peer review of changes to architecture diagrams
just as easy and effective as it is for code changes. That‚Äôs one of the reasons
we‚Äôre using Git and a feature branch to manage the changesets.

This step is necessarily fuzzy because I can‚Äôt know what system your team uses
for code review.

But I can give you some general guidance that might be helpful if you use one of
the most popular code hosting services.

First, you‚Äôll probably want to push your repository, and your branch, to your
team‚Äôs code hosting service.

Then, you‚Äôll want to open/create some kind of pull request, merge request,
review request, etc.

### Rough Workflow

1. Create a remote repository
   ([GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/),
   [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html#push-to-create-a-new-project),
   [BitBucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/get-started-with-bitbucket/create-a-repository-861178559.html))
1. Link the repositories
   ([GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/),
   [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html#push-to-create-a-new-project),
   [BitBucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository))
1. Push your branch to the remote repo: `$ git push -u origin spline-reticulator`
1. Open a Pull/Merge Request
   ([GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/),
   [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/index.html),
   [BitBucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request))
1. Bring the request to your colleague‚Äôs attention, however is customary in your
   team

If your team uses a different system and you‚Äôre not sure of the workflow, no
worries ‚Äî just ask one of your teammates to point you towards the docs.

## Revise

Hopefully you‚Äôll get some good feedback via peer review; if you‚Äôre lucky, it‚Äôll
be clear feedback that you can act on. If so, run `fc4 edit`, revise your model,
view, and/or styles, and add one or more commits to your branch. (You‚Äôll
probably want to push your new commits to the remote repository, depending on
your team‚Äôs process.)

## Merge

Once you‚Äôve received sufficient feedback from your team, and acceptance of your
work if that‚Äôs required by your team, then go ahead and merge your changes into
the repository‚Äôs master branch ‚Äî this is often done via the pull/merge/review
request, when applicable. (If you do the merge locally, don‚Äôt forget to push
the master branch to the remote repository.)

## Publish

When changing software, it‚Äôs [generally ideal](https://www.continuousdelivery.com)
to deploy or release a change as soon as it‚Äôs merged into master. In the case of
documentation, the equivalent is to _publish_ the change to wherever the docs
‚Äúlive‚Äù ‚Äî that is, their canonical location, the place where the audience looks
for and expects to find documentation on the subject
[landscape(s)](../../concepts.md#landscape).

Once again, this step is necessarily fuzzy because I can‚Äôt know what system your
team uses for hosting documentation.

That said, I can provide some tips:

* Consider publishing your FC4 corpus as a unit to a single place within your
  documentation hosting system. That can help build awareness that the corpus
  exists, and establish it as the place to go to find architecture diagrams.
* Consider automating the publication of your corpus, so that they‚Äôre
  automatically published whenever you merge changes to your master branch.
  * If your documentation isn‚Äôt sensitive, you might be interested in
    [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com),
    [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/), or
    [BitBucket‚Äôs static website hosting
    feature](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html)
    * A bonus benefit of using one of these systems is that your diagram images
      will be publicly available via a plain old URL, and therefore easily
      sharable and embeddable

## Publicize

Don‚Äôt forget to let people know that you‚Äôve published your diagrams! Many teams
aren‚Äôt used to even _having_ a canonical set of architecture diagrams that are
useful and can be counted on to be up to date. (By the way, keep your diagrams
up to date üòÖ)

Whether via a chat post, an email, or a [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org)
thread, spread the word!

## Maintain

As mentioned above, publishing a new diagram for the first time is huge, but
it‚Äôs also a beginning. Just as software must be be actively maintained and kept
up-to-date to be relevant and useful, so to documentation. Content should be
[current](http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/docs-principles/#current);
as per [the principles of the Write the Docs
community](http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/docs-principles/#current):
