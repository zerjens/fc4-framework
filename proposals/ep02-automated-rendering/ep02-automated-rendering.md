## Summary

The [current workflow](https://fundingcircle.github.io/fc4-framework/methodology/authoring_workflow.html) for rendering diagram images from their YAML source with fc4-tool is completely manual, onerous, tedious, error-prone, hard to learn, and inefficient. We should replace it with a new workflow enabled by automated image rendering.

## Status

The [recommended approach](#recommended-implementation-approach) was implemented in mid-November 2018. Key pull requests are labeled with [EP02](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4-framework/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+label%3AEP02+).


## New User Experience (Workflow)

1. The documentarian runs a command such as:
   1. `fc4 render diagrams/us/us_system_landscape.yaml path/to/another.yaml`
   1. `fc4 render diagrams/us/*.yaml`
1. fc4-tool would then render each specified diagram into a PNG file
   1. Every specified view would be rendered to a PNG file in the same directory and with the same file name as the YAML file, except for the extension.

## Desired Implementation Properties

I’m not sure if these are all possible, so let’s think of this as a wish list for now:

* A: Operates completely locally; does not require any sort of network connectivity
* B: Has as few additional system requirements as possible, ideally zero
* C: Operates completely in a single OS process
* D: Requires adding no additional programming systems to the tool

In other words: ideally a user would install and use fc4-tool as a single simple self-contained program with minimal dependencies and it’d just do its job on its own quickly and simply with predictable, straightforward failure modes, low resource utilization, and no race conditions.

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### Structurizr Express + Scripted Headless Browser

I had already started playing around with this approach when Simon Brown suggested it in [our correspondence](https://gist.github.com/aviflax/e274b87e558b3ca3d24a8c3f81843fc5). Using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev) with headless Chrome this is _fairly_ straightforward.

I’m recommending this approach because I’ve already got it implemented and working locally, and it’s looking good.

Here’s my evaluation of this approach against each of the properties listed above in [Desired Implementation Properties](#desired-implementation-properties):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">Property</th>
      <th align="left">My Take</th>
      <th align="left"><i>But</i> if we migrate the tool to ClojureScript on Node (as discussed <a href="#on-clojurescript">below</a>)…</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">A: Local Operation</th>
      <td>
        <p>Would depend on Structurizr Express being reachable and “up”.
      </td>
      <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">B: System Dependencies</th>
      <td>
        <p>Would add a single system dependency to fc4-tool: Chrome/Chromium. Which is no big deal since most users probably have it already anyway.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">C: Single Process</th>
      <td>The initial implementation would require Node to be run as a child process, and it would in turn run Chromium as a child process.</td>
      <td>…that would eliminate one of the processes, as Puppeteer would then be able to be called directly by the ClojureScript code.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">D: Single Programming System</th>
      <td>The initial implementation would require adding a single JavaScript file to the tool, simply because I already know JavaScript, I don’t know how to work with ClojureScript, and I want to make these changes as small and incremental as possible.</td>
      <td>…we’d then be able to port the JavaScript to ClojureScript, taking us back to a single programming system.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Alternate Implementation Approaches

If the recommended approach doesn’t work out, here are some ideas for  alternate approaches:

### Structurizr’s Web API

Structurizr does have a Web API, and I’ve [corresponded](https://gist.github.com/aviflax/e274b87e558b3ca3d24a8c3f81843fc5) with Simon Brown about whether and how we might be able to use it to programmatically render diagram images. It seems doable.

#### Cons

* Would depend on Structurizr being reachable and “up”
* Would _probably_ depend on the user having access to a paid Structurizr account or instance. (My impression is that the free plan wouldn’t support this.) (OTOH, we might be able to do this with the free plan by uploading the “workspace” as public, downloading the PNG(s), and then deleting the workspace. But that might be slow and/or error prone and/or have unacceptable failure modes.)

### Whimsical’s Hypothetical Web API

[Whimsical](https://whimsical.co/) is a commercial, closed-source, proprietary Web application for GUI-based diagramming. It has a compelling UX and produces very sharp diagrams that are aesthetically attractive. Based on reading blog posts by its creator, I gathered that it’s a data-driven application, so I [inquired](https://gist.github.com/aviflax/0f22c7b79dd76ecbaa9e19fe1bd652a0) as to whether they’d be interested in potentially providing a commercial Web service that would accept data and return images. The outcome of our discussion back in March of this year (2018) was that they definitely wanted to offer a full Web API at some point, not at that point but possible in ~6 months. We might want to consider getting back in touch to see whether this might be a viable scenario at this point.

### Paper.js + Scripted Headless Browser

I saw in [Whimsical’s architecture diagram](https://whimsical.co/Q5patpyGV3RDvkvkx1f6Ck) that their graphics are rendered with [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/). So I figure if they can use it to render attractive, clear, sharp vector graphics that can be exported as bitmaps, then maybe we can too. Would probably have to run in a headless browser, but might be acceptable.

#### Cons

* Pretty low-level; potentially lots of work to get the layout and aesthetics right
* Would add lots of system dependencies to fc4-tool: Node, Chrome, and maybe ClojureScript.

### Paper.js + JSDom

I found [in Paper’s README](https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js#installing-paperjs-for-nodejs) that it apparently supports rendering graphics in Node, as opposed to in a browser, via [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). This might be desirable because it wouldn’t require the user to have a recent version of Chrome installed. And, _if_ we were to [migrate fc4-tool to ClojureScript](#on-clojurescript), then this approach might not require any additional system dependencies beyond Node.

#### Cons

* Pretty low-level; potentially lots of work to get the layout and aesthetics right
* Might add a system dependency to fc4-tool: Node — unless we [migrate fc4-tool to ClojureScript](#on-clojurescript)

### JGraphX

[JGraphX](https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx) is a [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) [Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29) diagramming (graph visualisation) library. Back in February I created [a branch of fc4-tool](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4-framework/tree/jgraph) (and  [today](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4-framework/commit/41b646da8c54b067fd904b7e3cb27f6ed6d9347c#diff-79bf787a4b989cb5ae4e7b2571ce746c) I rebased it onto master and adapted it to the current state of the tool) that contains an experimental implementation of rendering a Structurizr Express diagram to a Swing view or [to a PNG file](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4-framework/blob/jgraph/tool/examples/internet_banking_context.png). It’s somewhat promising at the time; it can already render the diagrams such that they are recognizable and legible. But they aren't currently aesthetically attractive, and I don’t really have a clue whether it’s possible and/or practical to make Swing graphics aesthetically attractive.

### Apache Batik

[Batik](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/) is:

> a Java-based toolkit for applications or applets that want to use images in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format for various purposes, such as display, generation or manipulation.

…so I’d guess we’d be able to use it to generate “native” vector graphics and export them as PDF and PNG. The most compelling advantage here would be the ability to render images without any external dependencies such as Node, Puppeteer, Chrome, etc.

## On ClojureScript

fc4-tool is currently implemented with “just Clojure” i.e. the O.G. variant of [Clojure](https://clojure.org) that runs on the JVM. That’s as opposed to the other popular variant of Clojure, [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org), which is transpiled to JavaScript and thereby runs in browsers and/or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). The main reason for this is simply that it’s what I knew, so it was easiest for me. Ease matters sometimes, to some degree, but there are many instances wherein it is outweighed by other priorities, and this might be one of them. In the event that some approach for implementing automated rendering is highly compelling but would require running in Node, I’d be open to considering migrating all of fc4-tool to ClojureScript. (This might yield additional benefits such as reduced execution time.)

## On Other Programming Systems

Give the prior section, wherein I stated that in certain circumstances I’d be open to considering migrating all of fc4-tool to ClojureScript, one might wonder whether I’d be similarly open to migrating it to a completely unrelated programming system,  if we were to become aware of an extremely compelling diagram rendering library that runs in a different platform. My current stance on this is: maybe, but probably not. It’d have to be _extremely_ compelling to drive me to consider it seriously.
