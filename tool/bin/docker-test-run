# You might think this command should include --rm so as not to litter the

# debugging harder. Sometimes when the packaging scripts fail they write out
# files that are meant to help with debugging; if the container is deleted as
# soon as it exits then those files are gone. So you might want to run `docker
# container prune` every once in awhile ;)
