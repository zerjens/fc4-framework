;; This file refers to specs in the spec namespace `structurizr` that are
;; defined in the clojure file/ns that defines the namespace
;; fc4.integrations.structurizr.express.spec. *This* file/ns *cannot* require
;; *that* namespace because *that* file/ns requires this one, and that’d be
;; a dreaded cyclical dependency error. So this file/ns uses this spec namespace
;; by *reference* -- those specs may not actually exist (be registered) at
;; compile time, but they *must* have been registered at runtime.
;;
;; I know this is brittle; I’m open to suggestions.
